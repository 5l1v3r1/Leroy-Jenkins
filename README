Leroy Jenkins is a python tool that will allow
remote execution of commands on a Jenkins
server and its nodes. This tool provides an
interactive shell to perform all functions
remote and local.

This newer version of Leroy Jenkins has
a gui as well as the previous commands. 
To operate either run in the command
prompt leroy-jenkins.py or leroy-jenkins -g.
The -g option will open the gui. It is 
pretty self explainatory from there but
if you have questions please contact.

To install either run the insall.sh file
or copy all items to /usr/share/leroy-jenkins.
You can then create a .desktop file or sym 
links as needed.

For questions, comments, updates contact
James Luther through github.
